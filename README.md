# Pawfect Days

## What's this web app about? 👀

Pawfect Days is a marketplace of local dog walkers that enables dog owners to find trustworthy companions for their furbabies within a few minutes.

## What goes behind the design? 👩🏻‍💻

This web app uses React and Next.js for server-side rendering and static website generation. It also uses Tailwind – a utility-first CSS framework – to produce the web page's aesthetics in a modern and uniform style.

## How will it look? 🎨

## How to get started? 🏁

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Next steps 🚀
